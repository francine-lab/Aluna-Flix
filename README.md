# Alura Flix Project

The job was to show a location on the web page to obtain a valid entry for a movie poster address of the user's preference to be printed on the screen.

## Tasks performed to achieve this project

- The users are able to:
    - Type an address for a movie poster address on a specific place on the page
    - See those images of their movies on the screen

## Extra task

- I implemented a function that took the movie trailer's address of the user's preference and displayed these trailers on the screen. I also implemented a separated function to validate the entry :D
